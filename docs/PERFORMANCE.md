# Rendering performance

This page records how fast HiPlot renders large experiments, so every change
to the rendering path is measured against the same numbers.

## Method

`bench/make_experiments.py` generates three seeded experiments and renders
each to a standalone HTML page:

| Size | Rows | Columns | Column mix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5k × 20 | 5,000 | 20 | linear numeric, log-scale numeric (seven decades), categorical (3 to 12 values), sparse numeric with 2% inf and 3% NaN |
| 20k × 30 | 20,000 | 30 | same rotation |
| 50k × 50 | 50,000 | 50 | same rotation |

`bench/run.ts` opens each page in headless Chromium (full build, GPU enabled,
1600 × 1000 viewport) and measures, per page load:

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| HTML MB | Size of the standalone page, bundle included. |
| decode ms | Time inside `JSON.parse` or `eval` calls on strings over 1 MB, i.e. decoding the embedded experiment. |
| DOM ready ms | `domContentLoadedEventEnd`: HTML parse plus the synchronous setup script. |
| initial drawn ms | Navigation start to the last line draw call of the first render. |
| full redraw ms | A color-by change to the last draw call of the redraw. |
| drag frame p50 / p95 / max | Frame intervals while a brush is dragged across 50% of an axis, one mouse move per animation frame for 120 frames. |
| stalls | Frames longer than 50 ms during that drag. |
| brush end → lines ms | Mouse-up to the last line draw call. |
| brush end → table ms | Mouse-up to the last mutation of the table. |
| JS heap MB | `usedJSHeapSize` after the run. |

Line draws are Canvas2D `stroke`/`fill` and WebGL `draw*` calls, counted by
instrumentation the harness installs before any page script runs, so every
version of HiPlot is measured the same way. "Last draw" means no further draw
call for 500 ms and 20 frames. Each cell is the median of three page loads.

Reproduce:

```bash
bun run build
uv run python bench/make_experiments.py --out <dir>
node bench/run.ts --dir <dir> --reps 3 --label <name>
```

`bench/run.ts` runs under Node because Bun cannot yet drive Playwright's
browser pipe on Windows.

Machine: Windows 11, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (ANGLE / Direct3D 11), Chromium
from Playwright 1.63, 120 Hz frame clock (8.3 ms frames).

## Baseline

Commit `83d7897` (fork state before the forge conversion).

| Size | HTML MB | decode ms | DOM ready ms | initial drawn ms | full redraw ms | drag frame p50 / p95 / max ms | stalls | brush end → lines ms | brush end → table ms | JS heap MB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5k × 20 | 4.2 | 3 | 152 | 372 | 142 | 8 / 9 / 9 | 0/120 | 179 | 215 | 38 |
| 20k × 30 | 18.1 | 15 | 658 | 1443 | 663 | 8 / 17 / 17 | 0/120 | 631 | 185 | 262 |
| 50k × 50 | 69.4 | 64 | 2766 | 5946 | 2934 | 17 / 25 / 25 | 0/120 | 2730 | 273 | 542 |

Reading the baseline:

- Drag frames look smooth only because the progressive renderer draws at most
  300 lines per frame and restarts on every brush event. The cost shows up as
  latency instead: at 50k rows the lines finish drawing 2.7 s after the mouse
  is released, and a full redraw takes 2.9 s.
- Initial render time is dominated by line drawing (5.9 s at 50k), on top of
  2.8 s of HTML parsing for a 69 MB page whose payload is a JSON string inside
  a JavaScript string literal.
- The table updates within 300 ms of brush end at every size; DataTables with
  deferred rendering only builds the visible page.
